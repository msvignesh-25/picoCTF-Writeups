## STEPS/SOLUTION
Supporting screenshots and refernce images for this challenge are available in the [Images Folder](https://github.com/msvignesh-25/picoCTF-Writeups/tree/main/IMAGES) of this repository. Search for [Power Cookie](https://github.com/msvignesh-25/picoCTF-Writeups/tree/main/IMAGES/POWER%20COOKIE).
Start the instance and you will be provided the website's link.

1. Went to the website and it asked me to **Continue as Guest**.
2. I clicked the button and the page reported that guest services were not active.
3. The hint asked me if I know to modify the cookies, so I went to inspect the page source. You can do the same by right-clicking and choosing the inspect option.
4. The cookies data will be available in the Application tab in the Developer Tools page you will re-directed to. Refer to [this image](https://github.com/msvignesh-25/picoCTF-Writeups/blob/main/IMAGES/POWER%20COOKIE/Power%20Cookie.png) for locating the Application tab.
5. Now comes the interesting part of cookies manipulation. You have to change the cookie value from 0 to 1 and refresh the page. Refer to [this image](https://github.com/msvignesh-25/picoCTF-Writeups/blob/main/IMAGES/POWER%20COOKIE/Power%20Cookie-1.png).
6. The page which initially showed/revealed nothing, will reveal you the flag now.
