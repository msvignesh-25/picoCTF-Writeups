# CHALLENGE: First Grep

**DIFFICULTY:** EASY
**LINK:** [FIRST GREP](https://play.picoctf.org/practice/challenge/85?category=5&difficulty=1&originalEvent=1&page=1)

## DESCRIPTION
Can you find the flag in file? This would be really tedious to look through manually, something tells me there is a better way.

## STEPS/SOLUTION
1. Downloaded the [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/315d3325dc668ab7f1af9194f2de7e7a/file).
2. Read the hint and learnt about grep [here](https://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/grep.php).
3. Used the command 'grep "picoCTF{" file' as the name of the downloaded [file](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/315d3325dc668ab7f1af9194f2de7e7a/file) is *file*. If in future challenges, usage of grep is necessary, the format is grep (pattern) filename.
4. This will show us the flag.

*And there we got the flag!!*
